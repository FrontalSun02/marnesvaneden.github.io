                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a spontaneous, loyal, and hardworking Twenty-Three-year-old that enjoys life. I am a self-motivated, disciplined person and has clear goals. I get along with people very well and functions well in a group, and alone. I am able to analyze any situation and adapt accordingly.
                    I matriculated in 2020 with 2 distinctions. I initially enrolled at the North West University Potchefstroom for a Bachelor’s Degree in Electrical Engineering, but found that I enjoyed the programming subjects more and decided to convert to BSc Information Technology. I successfully completed the first year of BSc Information Technology with 3 distinctions and second year with 7 distinctions with a current GPA of 70.85. I am currently enrolled in my 3rd year of BSc IT.
